This expanded example combines the ofxLeapMotion openFrameworks add-on examples from https://github.com/ofTheo/ofxLeapMotion with additional functionality. 

Code and commenting was done in collaboration between Glenna Xie (https://github.com/glennax) & Jinnie Templin (https://github.com/jin-temp)

######This LeapMotion Example has the following functionality:
- draws a 3D grid so you can see your hand in 3D space

- draws lines when gestures are detected so that users can more easily interpret how the leap is translating hand movement
- the color of the drawn line changes based on whether a finger gesture or hand gesture is detected
- after a finger gesture, the paths of the fingers are drawn; after a hand gesture, the path of the palm is drawn
